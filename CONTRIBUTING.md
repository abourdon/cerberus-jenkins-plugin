# How to contribute?

Want to contribute to the Ceberus's Jenkins plugin? Great! Here are few steps in order to allow you pushing your changes.

The original sources are maintained in the [CerberusTesting's cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin](https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin) repository. Those sources are then forked to the [Jenkins organisation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/cerberus-testing-plugin) to be able to install this Jenkins plugin directly from the Jenkins' marketplace.

Therefore, the way to update sources is the following:
1. Clone your own version of the [CerberusTesting's cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin](https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin) repository
2. Ask for pull request from your repository to the [CerberusTesting's cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin](https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin)
3. [CerberusTesting's cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin](https://github.com/cerberustesting/cerberus-cicd-jenkins-plugin) owners will then sync your changes with the [JenkinsCI' one](https://github.com/jenkinsci/cerberus-testing-plugin)


Happy contributing!
